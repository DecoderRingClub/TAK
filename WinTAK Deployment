## WinTAK Deployment
>**Note:** This again was for a specific deployment, but hopefully these notes will act as a guide if you want to try out these powerful tools.

### Install WinTAK
1. You will likely be using WinTAK CIV (MIL if you have the right need), which can be easily located online and is provided free. 

>**Note:** Other flavors of TAK are in the wild, such as ATAK (Android) and iTAK (Apple). iTAK was a second thought since most DoD users operate with ATAK, and thus, iTAK is missing many functions.

2. Once you've installed WinTAK, navigate to the three dashes in the top left corner and select settings.
3. Select ``Network Preferrences``
4. Select ``Manage Server Connections``
5. If you followed my previous instruction set, you'll be setting this up with SSL, so select it. You should see more options now.
6. Enter your IP address for the TAK server and enter the port ``8089`` unless changed.
7. Click the top button to select your truststore cert (should be ``truststore-root.p12``) and enter the password for the cert.
8. Next, click the button below to select your client cert (should be ``admin.p12 or user.p12``) and again, enter the password.
9. Hit okay in the bottom.
